            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Control Version System (CVS) is a system many programmers use to collaborate with other programmers in such a way that doesn’t leave them infuriated and the project bugged with code that interferes with itself. A CVS allows people to take the same versions of code and save it as a different version from the one sent to them. They can also track the changes made by others and fall back to previous versions if the current versions turn out to have enumerable errors. A VCS most commonly runs as stand-alone application like git hub, but revision control is also embedded in various types of software such as word processors and spreadsheets, collaborative web docs such as Google Docs and in various systems, such as Wikipedia's Page history. Revision control allows for the ability to revert a document to a previous revision, which is critical for allowing editors to track each other's edits, correct mistakes, and defend against vandalism and spamming. The aforementioned vandalism is most common amongst hacker who will try to input malicious code into a document to steal information from people who read the page, they can take everything from passwords to bank account information and sell it in the deep web. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Git development began in April 2005, Linus Torvalds wanted a distributed system that everyone could use, but none of the systems he found met his needs or criteria, especially when it came to performance. Torvalds used an example of a source-control management system needing 30 seconds to apply a software patch and update all associated data, and knew that this would not scale to the needs of his development, where syncing with fellow programmers could require 250 such actions at once. For his design criteria, he specified that patching should take no more than three seconds, and added three more points: One, Take Concurrent Versions System as an example of what not to do; if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision Include very strong safeguards against corruption, either accidental or malicious. In the end he created GIT, the evolution of the CVS that was more streamlined and avoided a lot of the hang ups the system had come across. It is now one of the most popular codes that people can use and is free the public thanks in no small part to being created of the Linux kernel, this free system has help lay the ground work for some of the biggest sites on the internet.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> A README file holds information about the files in a given directory or library of computer software. A system of documentation, it usually has a simple plain text file called READ.ME, README.TXT, README.md. A README file is a condition in the GNU Coding Standards Since the advent of the web as a de facto platform for distribution of software and its products, many software packages have moved some of the above subsidiary files and pieces of information to different places and locations within a library, sometimes the README itself, or sometimes leaving behind only a brief README file without all of the information required by a new user of the software which can be a dangerous way to have copyright infringement and other legal troubles occur. However, the popularity of GitHub (as well as older community conventions) has contributed towards README files still being widely used in open-source software. On GitHub, if a Git repository has a README file in its main directory, it is automatically converted into formatted HTML and presented on the subsequent web page. Various versions of file extensions can be used, and conversion to HTML takes account of the file extension of the file as well.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Cloud9 IDE is an online integrated development environment that allows for the development of code in a free environment. Published as open source from version 3.0. It supports hundreds of programming languages, including C, C++, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Python, JavaScript with Node.js, and Go. It enables developers to get started with coding immediately with pre-configured workspaces and is a great place to learn coding basics and to teach others within a safe environment or collaborate with their peers with collaborative coding features similar to a CVS, and web development features like live preview and browser compatibility testing to help with debugging. As per their official blog, Cloud9 had been acquired by Amazon in July 2016. Cloud9 IDE, Inc. is the company that actively maintains Cloud9 IDE. The company has offices in San Francisco and Amsterdam. It is important to note that the free site with its plethora of different programming languages has made it from impossible to experiment with code concepts, and ideas about development, to a virtual given as collaborations take place regularly on the site. Time will tell what wonderful programs or terrible viruses will emerge as people develop and evolve code in this unique and wonderfully free environment.   </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Some of the best websites, from Facebook to google started off as nothing more than a collaboration between a group of people with code. Coding is not a new phenomenon by any stretch of the imagination, having started in the 70’s with IT people working on primitive computers that could do the most basic task. By the 90’s however, that idea of people working together had been a well-worn path with things such as Linux and the first adventure game called ‘Adventure Quest’ being created through collaboration of IT departments of colleges in America and beyond. Over time though this idea has begun to take on a more sinister context as hacker regularly operate in networks to extort people by holding their files ransom and using bot systems to bring down major websites and even our nations infrastructures and defense. To combat the pentagon has had to use similar tactics by using massive collaborations and networks to detect and prevent the next great cyber-attack. This has led to the internet becoming a sort of wild west for the individual were you can find good teams of programmers and those with more malicious intentions all sharing the same space.  </p>
